======
* 2<sup>nd</sup> of February, 2022: Our paper `Invariant Ancestry Search`, which gives a novel approach to estimating sets of causal ancestors using Invariant Causal Prediction methods, is now [live on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00913)
* 13<sup>th</sup> of August, 2021: The R-package `TMTI`, implementing the methods from our paper `'Too Many, Too Improbable' test statistics: A general method for testing joint hypotheses and controlling the k-FWER` has been published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TMTI/index.html). [![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/TMTI)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TMTI) 
* 10<sup>th</sup> of August, 2021: Our paper `'Too Many, Too Improbable' test statistics: A general method for testing joint hypotheses and controlling the k-FWER` is now on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04731)
* 19<sup>th</sup> of August, 2020: The paper `Causal structure learning from time series: Large regression coefficients may predict causal links better in practice than small p-values` has been accepted into PMLR and is now available at [PMLR online](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v123/).
* 1<sup>st</sup> of April, 2020: My coworkers, Martin Emil Jakobsen and Nikolaj Thams, and I have made a [dashboard](http://shiny.science.ku.dk/pbm/COVID19/) tracking the worldwide progress, which led to an [interview in Danish television today](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/nyheder/01-04-2020/1930/ny-corona-app?autoplay=1) along with an [article](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/koebenhavn/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler). See also the [UCPH announcement](https://nyheder.ku.dk/alle_nyheder/2020/04/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler/) featuring [a short video](http://video.ku.dk/fa-overblik-over-corona-pandemien-1). 
* 3<sup>rd</sup> of March, 2020: Our invited paper, `Causal structure learning from time series: Large regression coefficients may predict causal links better in practice than small p-values`, for PMLR is [live on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09573).
* 14<sup>th</sup> of December, 2019: I, along with a team of coworkers at UCPH, have won the NeurIPS challenge [Causality for Climate](https://causeme.uv.es/neurips2019/), in which we were given the task of estimating the underlying causal graphs of various time series from climate data ([code](https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench), [NeurIPS presentation](https://nikolajthams.github.io/docs/slides/pres_neurips_2019.pdf), [UCPH announcement](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/cocala-winner-c4c/), [Amazon announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/neurips-competition-tackles-climate-data-challenges/))
* 8<sup>th</sup> of November, 2019: The company JP Statistics, which my business partner Josva Engmose Jensen and I have started, has launched! We provide consultancy on various statistical/data science tasks. Please write us at contact@jpstatistics.com requests.
* 15<sup>th</sup> of August, 2019: Started a Ph.D. position at UCPH, Department of Mathematical Sciences, under the supervision of Bo Markussen, Helle SÃ¸rensen and Shyam Gopalakrishnan.
* 8<sup>th</sup> of March, 2019: I succesfully defended my Master's thesis `Greedy Learning of Causal Structures in Additive Noise Models`, which was written under the supervision of Jonas Peters (UCPH), and I can now call myself a Master of Science with a degree in Mathematics-Economics.
